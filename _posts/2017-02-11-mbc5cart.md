This is an MBC5 compatible Gameboy cartridge! It will work with almost all Gameboy games, including LSDJ. **Because of limited save ram available, only one LSDJ song can be saved on the cart.** This is intended as an entry-level LSDJ cart so you can get a grip with the software before spending more money on a more full-featured cart. It will also work great with the [Arduinoboy](http://catskullelectronics.com/arduinoboy)!

Enter the name of the ROM you'd like to have flashed on the cart in the text box before adding it to your cart. If I can't find the ROM, I'll contact you via your PayPal email address. If you'd like LSDJ on the cart, I'll ask to see proof of your LSDJ license.

They come in a red shell and a cartridge case is included.

No cartridge label is included.
