## Details:

Shipping is flat rate $5 in the US. International shipping is flat rate $15.

This is a super simple 1 input, 5 output MIDI thru. It will repeat the input signal on all outputs. They are great if you're using many synths from the same MIDI interface.

It requires a micro USB connection for power. It is not powered passively. Also the micro USB is only for power, it does not do USB MIDI.

The kit version has all surface mount parts soldered, you just need to solder the DIN-5 jacks on. It's pretty easy to solder, but I'd recommend having some soldering experience. You'll also need a good soldering iron and solder. I can't offer any support or warranty for the kit version.

The assembled version comes fully assembled and tested. If you just want a hassle free product, choose this option!

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
