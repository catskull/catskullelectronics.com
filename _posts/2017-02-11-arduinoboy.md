## This arduinoboy kit has been replaced by the [Teensyboy Pro](https://catskullelectronics.com/teensyboypro). I am no longer offering assembled kits. These are still for sale, but I can't offer any support.

## As of Feb. 11, 2019, I am no longer offering pre-flashed Arduino UNOs. You can buy them just as cheap as I can!

### PS/2 Mode is now integrated into the regular LSDJ keyboard mode. Because of this, the mode button has moved to another pin. I've also eliminated one resistor, so assembly should be easier than ever! You can download the code [here](https://github.com/catskull/Arduinoboy/archive/master.zip).

## Details:

Ships within 5 business days.

The Arduinoboy kit has been replaced by the Teensyboy Pro. It's better in every way!

It is important to understand that you're buying a kit. That means it's a PCB with unsoldered components. For assembly,  you'll need a soldering iron and decent soldering skills. All the components are through-hole, so it should be easy enough for beginners. That said, I take no responsibility for any damage you cause to your kit during assembly. **There is strictly no warranty whatsoever included with the kit. No returns or refunds will be accepted.**

There are known issues with Arduino Duemilanove 168 and Arduino Mega 2560. Please use an Arduino UNO with this kit.

You'll need a good link cable to use this. I have tested these and they seem to be great: [http://www.ebay.com/itm/400690419424](http://www.ebay.com/itm/400690419424)
