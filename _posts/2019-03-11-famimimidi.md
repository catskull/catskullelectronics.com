All the way from Tokyo, Japan comes an all-new NES MIDI interface! Designed as a modern day midines, Famimimidi lets you take full control of your NES sound hardware from the conveninece of your favorite MIDI workplace.

Famimimidi is extremely powerful, but harnessing it's full potential will take some effort and experimention. Please [read the manual]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/famimimidi/manual.pdf) and MIDI implementation carefully before ordering so you know fully what you're getting yourself into. For example, compared to midines, there is no on screen interface. What Famimimidi lacks in user friendliness, it makes up for with how powerful it is.

Famimimidi works on both PAL and NTSC systems. It has also been tested on a Famicom with an adapter.

Units ship with the cartridge and a printed manual.

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
