## Details:

{% include shipping_estimate.html %}

This is a nice little PS/2 adapter cable for your Gameboy Pocket, Color, Advance, and anything else with that size link port! To use this you'll need a PS/2 keyboard, a Gameboy, and a copy of LSDJ.

End to end, the cable measures about 2 feet (60 cm).

If you'd like to use a DMG instead, check out my [DMG PS/2 adapter](/dmgps2)!
