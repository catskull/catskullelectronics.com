## Details:

**International buyers: [contact me](mailto:bro@catskull.net) before purchasing.**

Units ship within **5** business days.

Shipping is flat rate $3 in the US.

This is a nice little PS/2 adapter cable for your Gameboy Pocket, Color, Advance, and anything else with that size link port! To use this you'll need a PS/2 keyboard, a Gameboy, and a copy of LSDJ (my [MBC5 cart](http://catskullelectronics.com/mbc5cart) will work great as a starter).

End to end, the cable measures about 2 feet (60 cm).

If you'd like to use a DMG instead, check out my [DMG PS/2 adapter](/dmgps2)!

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it's correct.
