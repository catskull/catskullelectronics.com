It's a cheap knockoff Gameboy cart shell! The plastic is not great, but not horrible. The color is not quite what an OEM shell is, but it's in the ballpark. There are some bumps on the inside of the shell, you may want to scrape those off to get a better fit. All in all, it's a cheap shell and you get what you pay for! Good enough for me!

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it's correct.
