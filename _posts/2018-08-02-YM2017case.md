## Details:

### This does not include the YM2017 cartridge, this is just a case for it.

Shipping is flat rate $6 in the US. International shipping is flat rate $15.

Included is a super cheap and flimsy black plastic case and a double sided insert that has both art styles shown.

If you have preoredered YM2017 from the second batch, you don't need to pay extra shipping. I'll simply combine shipping. If you don't have an outstanding YM2017 preorder, you will need to pay shipping again. After you order, I will check to see if you have a preorder outstanding and if so I'll refund the shipping amount. Please make sure you use the same PayPal account that you used to preorder YM2017.

Seriously this case is really cheap, if you don't like that I would recommend just printing your own label and using an official case.

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it’s correct.

By purchasing, you are acknowledging that you've read and understand this page as well as my [FAQ](/faq) page.
