This is a super simple adapter cable that has a 1/8" (3.5mm) male cable on one end, and a female DIN-5 cable on the other end. End to end, the cable is about 6 inches (15cm) long. For added flair, each end is red and the cable in between is black.

This adapter follows the [official MIDI TRS spec](https://www.midi.org/articles-old/trs-specification-adopted-and-released). Specifically, the following table lists which devices are compatible with this cable:
