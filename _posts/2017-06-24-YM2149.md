It's a tiny little chip synth! The YM2149 is a neat little chip that was used in various retro arcade machines and consoles, including the Atari ST. It features three adjustable voices. They are mapped to MIDI channels 1-3.

This synth is wrapped in clear heat shrink tubing for protection and durability.
