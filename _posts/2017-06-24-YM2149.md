### A web-based patch editor is now available! Due to a dependance on web midi, only the Google Chrome is supported. It's highly recommended you backup the default presets before messing around! Check it out here: [https://ym2149editor.netlify.com](https://ym2149editor.netlify.com/)

### A Max for Ableton Live plugin is now available! Check it out: [http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/4520/ym2149-synth](http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/4520/ym2149-synth)

It's a tiny little chip synth! The YM2149 is a neat little chip that was used in various retro arcade machines and consoles, including the Atari ST. It features three adjustable voices. They are mapped to MIDI channels 1-3.

This synth is wrapped in clear heat shrink tubing for protection and durability.
