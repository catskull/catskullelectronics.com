## Details:

**International buyers: [contact me](mailto:bro@catskull.net) before purchasing.**

Carts ship within **3** business days.

Shipping is flat rate $3 in the US.

The min64 is a simple Commodore 64/128 cartridge. It is designed to sit flush with the cartridge slot, so it does not protrude out of the back. This allows the cartridge to remain safely in the Commodore at all times and will be safe during transportation.

The min64 is designed to work with a variety of ROMs. I use 2764 ROMs. If you use a larger ROM, it is necessary to duplicate the data to fill up the entire chip.

At checkout, enter a ROM you'd like flashed on the cart. If I can't find the ROM or it doesn't work, I'll let you know. I use the email tied to your PayPal account for communications so make sure it's current. You can always just contact me before purchase if you have concerns.

I will ship to the address entered on the PayPal checkout page, so please double check to make sure it's correct.

By purchasing from me, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions and acknowledging that you have read this page.
