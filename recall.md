## All analog sync adapters shipped before March 25 are faulty

A small change between pre-production PCBs and production PCBs caused all production PCBs to not work. The Gameboy link connector isn't properly grounded.

### The Good News

The good news is that it's a pretty simple fix. Simply take a wire and solder it between the two points as shown:

### The Other News

Selling a faulty product is below the standards I hold myself and this shop up to. You shouldn't have to fix the products I sell you. Because of that, I'm doing a voluntary recall. If you don't want to fix your own (or you just feel like you should have gotten a working product), please <a href="mailto:support@catskullelectronics.com?subject=Analog Sync Replacement">contact me</a> contact me and I will send you a new unit at no cost to you.

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to get in contact.

Thank you for your continued patience, understanding, and support.
